Creating a rock-paper-scissors game:

Print images of 'rock' 'paper' and 'scissors'.
Print a timer for each player.
    Timer starts counting down from 10 seconds.
Accept user input from both ends.
    If no user input is obtained from both players, the game restarts.
After the timer reaches 0, print both user inputs on screen.
Identify the winner.
