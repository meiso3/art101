			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab is to understand the importance of pseudocode before actually coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We initially decided on making a pseudocode for macarons but then we realized it would be way too complicated and wordy. So we scratched that idea and decided on a pasta recipe. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went really well. I completed it with my partner Diane at the library. I would say we both put in a good amount of energy on this project. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<h3>Task 1: Pseudocode pasta from scratch</h3>
				<p>(We used ChatGPT for this recipe)
				<ol>
					<li>Gather the ingredients:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Flour</li>
						<li> Eggs</li>
						<li> Salt</li>
						<li> Water if needed</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
					<li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
					<li>Crack the eggs into the well.</li>
					<li>Use a fork to gently beat the eggs and gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
					<li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
					<li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>Once the dough has rested, roll it out with a rolling pin or pasta machine to the desired thickness.</li>
					<li>Cut the dough into the desired shape (such as spaghetti or fettuccine).</li>
					<li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water for 2-4 minutes (depending on the thickness of the pasta).</li>
					<li>Drain the pasta and serve with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
					<li>Enjoy your homemade pasta!</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments</h3>
				<pre>
//Print images of 'rock' 'paper' and 'scissors' on the screen.
//Print a timer for each player (10 seconds).
//Timer starts counting down from 10 seconds:
	//while seconds is greater than 0
		//print the value in seconds
		//subtract 1 from seconds
//Accept user input from both ends.
//If no user input is obtained from both players
	//The game restarts.
//When the timer reaches 0
	//Print both user inputs on screen.
//Print the winner's username.
				</pre>
